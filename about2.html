	<div class="about-text">
		<p>Shannon comes from humble beginnings on the east coast of Canada in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Her interest in a natural and active lifestyle began at a young age, albeit subliminally, from attending and later working at a wilderness outdoor summer camp on the province's northwestern coastline. It was there that she learned about the appreciation of mother nature and about expressing gratitude for everything that abounds from her glory. Many days were spent on ocean canoe trips, extended wilderness hikes and even living in a tipi for 3 months. </p>

			<p>Upon graduating from high school, Shannon attended Memorial University in St. John's, Newfoundland; she completed a semester abroad studying French in Nice, France and returned home to the east coast in search of something entirely different: a mountain lifestyle. She promptly moved to Whistler, British Columbia, the place she has called home for the last four years. </p>

			<p>Shannon has truly found her passions in the coastal mountains of British Columbia. She is an avid snowboarder, mountain biker, yogi, hiker and swimmer; she has recently begun competing in triathlons as well. </p>

			<p>It has been an intrinsic progression for Shannon to obtain a diploma in Holistic Nutrition from the Canadian School of Naturopathic Nutrition after becoming so profoundly attached to the natural world in all its facets. With this knowledge, Shannon plans to reach out to the public and educate on the true meaning of mindfulness: from what we eat, to how we feel about ourselves and how we ultimately treat others and our beautiful planet through these mindful acts. </p>
